# Multilayer Perceptron (Aka Feedforward Neural Network)

This project is a simple implementation of a neural network in Python. It utilizes a sigmoid activation function and mean squared error loss to train the model on a synthetic dataset. The network is built from scratch, providing insights into the basics of neural network operations including forward and backward propagation.

## Features
- Custom neural network implementation.
- Many activation functions like Sigmoid and ReLU and loss functions like mean squared error.
- Training and evaluation on a synthetic dataset.
- Visualization of training loss and neuron weights.
- Exploratory data analysis of the synthetic dataset. [EDA](src/eda.ipynb)

## Setup
Ensure you have Python installed, then set up your environment:
```bash	
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Execute the program to see the Neural Network in action:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Testing
To run the tests, execute:
```bash
pytest
```
